# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Ryan Ruiz

This social media app, Pikucha was inspired by many things. Similar to a well known app named Pinterest you can upload pictures as well as view, save, and comment on others posts as well. When decided on what I was going to do for my project I thought about what is most impactful in todays age, for my generation and the generations to come. I found that social media has created a huge change in the lives of everyone who have opted to be a part of the space. Social media isnt only a place to find entertainment but a place where you can express and educate yourself as well as network and meet new people with similar interests. It connects us in ways that were never possible in the past. With technology becoming more advanced I see the use and ultmitely the need for social media increasing. I am also very savvy when it comes to social media platforms being that I myself use many of them. This is why I opted to create the Pikucha app. 
With this app you will be able to create, edit and delete images. YOu can share your favorite photos and express yourself via your posts. Others may choose to interact with your posts and vice versa via likes, comments, and saves. You will be able to search and filter images along with building your profile to express your interest. You see something that interests you, save it to your profile. You can not only view from a desktop but from a mobile device as well. You can also include links with your photos if you want other users to learn more about what you are trying to portay or just simply want to give some extra info. 
I opted to use React.js in this project as it was one of the courses I found most interesting throughout my bootcamp. I had to dive deep into notes from class but aside form that I did a lot of my own research to implement some new and advanced practices throughout my code. Some examples of this are file and folder structure as well as Hooks and Refs. I also added Google Authentication and built the UI using Tailwind CSS. I also opted to use and learn something new that caught my interests throughtout my time in the bootcamp. I used Sanity to manage all of the content of my application. Sanity is something I always asked my instructors about as it seemed to make everything so much easier. I found that with Sanity you are able to build scaleable and user friendly applications with ease. Having Sanity to manage all your content makes is great. It also has an open source editing environment that can be customized with JS and a real time hosted data store. There are some errors that I still receive while using the app, although nothing that directly effects the UI. I also had some friends test the app and it seems to have some issues with proportions of photos being bigger than others causing certain photos to be blurry. This is definetely a project that I will continue to work on and scale as much as possible and continue to grow my knowledge. Although I must finally submit now, there is a lot more functionality I would like to add to this app such as following other users, tagging usernames, and so much more. I cannot wait to see what this app will look like by next year.
